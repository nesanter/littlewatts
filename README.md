## Amplifiers

### Punk Amp 1
Punk-1 is a single-ended Class-A design using six transistors.
 * G = 19dB (400mV/1W sensitivity)
 * Distortion at 1W into 8 ohms is 0.05% split between second and third harmonic.
 * Distortion at 5W into 8 ohms is 0.63% primarily second harmonic.
 * Distortion crosses 1% at 5.3W and is primarily second harmonic.
 * Approximately 1A is drawn from idle to rated power.
 * Dissipation in the upper transistor varies from 6W to 10W at no load.
 * Dissipation in the lower transistor is fairly constant at 10W.

(Note: all figures above assume 24V supply and purely resistive load.)

### Punk Amp 2
Punk-2 is a single-ended Class-A design using eleven transistors.

With a 24V supply:
 * G = 29dB (130mV/1W sensitivity)
 * Distortion at 1W into 8 ohms is 0.001% primarily second harmonic.
 * Distortion at 5W into 8 ohms is 0.003% split between second and third harmonic.
 * Distortion at 9.3W into 8 ohms is 0.1%.
 * Distortion increases quickly to 1% around 10W and 4% by 11W.
 * Approximately 2A are drawn from idle to rated power.
 * Dissipation in lower and upper transistors is fairly constant at 25W.

With a 30V supply:
 * G = 29dB (130mV/1W sensitivity)
 * Distortion at 1W into 8 ohms is 0.001%.
 * Distortion at 5W into 8 ohms is 0.004%.
 * Distortion at 15W into 8 ohms is 0.01%.
 * Distortion increases very quickly above 15W (e.g. 2% at 16W)
 * Approximately 4A are drawn from idle to around 3A at rated power.
 * Dissipation in the upper transistor is fairly constant at 40W.
 * Dissipation in the lower transistor varies from 30W to 40W.
 * Almost certainly requires active cooling.
